# Homework 1 - Secret Santa, Multiplication without operator, Multiplication Recursively

# Prompted ChatGPT to asssist with the initial understanding of the problem and what the correct path was.
# I specify "no code in this thread" and "only discuss at a high level, don't describe full implementation"
# GPT directed me towards using a graph-based approach to model the problem, I did some research and landed on this solution.
